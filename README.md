# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

The goal of this analysis was to analyze metrics that affect how manufacturers manufacture cars and compare them to the MechaCar and how the manufacturer will manufacture their cars.  The metrics that got analyzed were vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD, MPG and PSI.

A statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition would be linear regression on city and highway fuel efficiency and MPG.  Since Gas is getting more expensive many customers will put a lot of importance when purchasing a car.  In the study the metrics I would test are city and highway fuel efficiency and MPG of the MechaCar compared to the competition.  My hypothesis would be that cars with better fuel efficiency the more likely a consumer is to buy a vehicle.  The null hypothesis would be that fuel efficiency and MPG have little to no influence on car buying.   Statistical tests I would use to test the hypothesis are city and highway fuel efficiency, HP, weight, MPG and price.  I would use fuel efficiency and MPG to compare the MechaCar to other vehicles.  I would also see if weight is a factor in fuel efficiency.  Lastly, I would use HP to see what effect that has on fuel efficiency.  The data needed to run the statistical tests would be the fuel efficiency, HP, weight and MPG of the competitionâ€™s vehicles.  I would use price to see if the above had an influence on the buyer.
